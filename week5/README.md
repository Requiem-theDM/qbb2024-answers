## Exercise 1
- 1.1: Likely this data is different from the expected distributions as it is RNAseq data specifically for Drosophilia midguts, rather than from all tissue types.

- 1.2: The sequence is from Drosophila melanogaster strain Canton S serine protease 3, serine protease 1 (SER1), and serine protease 2 (SER2) genes. Serine proteases and their homologs constitute the second largest family of genes in the drosophilia genome, so are understandably highly represented.

## Exercise 2
- 15 samples
- Each cluster of replicates in triplicate seems to be most similar to other clusters, meaning that consistency between rounds of experimentation was high.

## Exercise 3.3
- LFC-Fe Replicate 3 and Fe Replicate 1 appear to have their labelings reversed.

## Exercise 3.6
- Broadly yes, as the majority of enrichments appear to be involved in metabolic processes, which is sensible given their derivation from midgut tissues.
