## Exercise 2.3
- 1. Exons appear to be under the highest degree of prufiying selection, as their expression values most substantially decrease as MAF increases.

- 2. A higher minor allele frequency suggests that there are a limited selection of high frequency alleles within a given population, meaning that the vast majority of the population will have either the most common, or second most common allele, leaving only a tiny fraction who has a different variant, as represented by decreasing enrichment with increasing MAF.

- 3. Broadly, yes, as the three noncoding regions of the genome are under approximately the same degree of selective pressure as eachother, while exons appear to be under a substantially increased selective pressure, likely due to their status as coding genes.
