# Question 3.1
The nascent RNA signal represents how much nascent RNA is present in the nucleus of a given cell as a representation of active transcription. It is provided as the average signal in a given nuclei from a particular field of a particular knockdown condition.

The PCNA signal represents how much PCNA is present in the nucleus of a given cell as a representation of DNA replication and repair. It is provided as the average signal in a given nuclei from a particular field of a particular knockdown condition.

The ratio between the two provides a ratio of RNA transcription to DNA replication.

# Question 3.2
SRSF1 has the highest ratio, which given that it regulates splicing makes sense, as nascent RNA transcripts are traditionally detected through the detection of introns, thus if introns are not being spliced out, SRSF1's knockdown may result in accumulation of "nascent" transcripts in the nucleus, thus resulting in a large numerator for the ratio.

APEX1 has the lowest ratio, which makes sense as PCNA can serve as a marker of DNA repair by Polymerase epsilon, and APEX1 knockout typically results in accumulation of DNA damage, thus resulting in a large denominator for the ratio.
